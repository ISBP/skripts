# skripts
A collection of my public skripts :)
# IMPORTANT:
Some skripts DO require addons!
Visit the Wiki tab to see how to use the skripts! [In Progress]
My skripts are *currently* being tested on Skript version 2.9.1 on a Paper MC Server Running 1.20.4 with plugin Vault, Skuishy, SKBee and SKLib, however all my skripts (on my last testing) work without any addons (Unless listed on the top of the skript)!
